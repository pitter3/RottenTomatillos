[# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Abstract:
Welcome to our Rancid Tomatillos app! 

Are you trying to find an exciting movie to watch today but you’re unsure of which one to chose from? Look no further! Our app is the perfect one for you! Our app will greet you with a list of movies for you to choose from. All you have to do is click on the individual movie you are interested in. Our app will then display more information about the movie for you; such as: run time, rating, genre, summary and more! If the movie doesn’t interest you, you can click on the logo on the left or the home button to bring you back to the main dashboard of all of the movies.

## Context:
This is the first project of Mod 3 at Turing School of Software & Design. We were given ~1.5 weeks to create this project from scratch using a provided comp found. We probably spent 50-60 hours on this project over the week. This project is our first attempt at making a react app, and we used many new technologies such as react-router, cypress e2e testing, responsive design, and proptypes.

## Learning Goals:
Gain competency with React fundamentals
Test React components & asynchronous JS
Practice refactoring
Create a multi-page UX using Router
